# Hangmangame
I created this repository as part of my python practice from my python learning journey. 
The repository is named Hangmangame because the hangman game was my very first commit.
There are/will be a whole other interesting projects in there for you tp to look at
feel free to let me know areas where I can improve on and how I can make my code better
